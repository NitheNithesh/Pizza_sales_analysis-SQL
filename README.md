Detailed Analysis of Pizza Sales Patterns Using SQL

The Pizza_Sales zip file contains datasets on pizza sales. Pizza_Analysis_Questions refers to different areas of insights that needs to be known by analysis.

This analysis examines patterns and trends in pizza sales data over a one-year period. It identifies specific information and insights, such as the distribution of pizza types by revenue, the distribution of pizza categories by revenue, and the percentage contribution of pizza types to revenue and so on. These findings help us understand sales patterns and identify areas for improvement.

In this analysis project, I moslty utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with window functions instead of subqueries. CTEs with window functions offer advantages in terms of readability, code reusability, and high efficiency performance.
